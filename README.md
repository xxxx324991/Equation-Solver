Equation-Solver (C++)
A robust numerical engine designed to solve quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations. The core of this project is a comprehensive, custom-built Complex Number class that handles the intricate logic of algebraic field extensions.

Key Achievement: Custom Complex Class
While many use standard libraries, this project implements a full-featured Complex Number system from the ground up to ensure maximum control over precision and logic flow.
